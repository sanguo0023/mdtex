\section{About the package}

Thank for your reading.
I'm a student and this package is create on my lesson for python/latex.
I'm sorry to there are some bug have no fixed and more bug in unknown runtime.
I hope use MVC(Model-View-Control) design patterns into LaTeX Writing(sure, there is no model part).
This page is compiled with pyLatex(call the latex:pdflatex commands) if you are reading README.pdf, it also can find from output directory.

\subsection{Directory structure}


\begin{verbatim}
	├── pyTex
	│   ├── demo.py
	│   ├── __init__.py
	│   ├── md2tex.py
	│   ├── output
	│   ├── pyLatex.py
	│   └── templates
	│       └── example.tex
	└── setup.py
\end{verbatim}


\subsubsection{Subdirectories}

We have two special default directories \textit{ output } and \textit{ templates }, and the directories also can be changed in pyLatex.py. you can create and modify your own LaTeX templates in your templates directory, and call compile method to output tex/pdf file in your output directory.

\subsubsection{Source Code}

There are two python class, pyLatex class to parse templates tags and render content from user to templates, it also have a method named compile that call the command \textit{ pdflatex } from LaTeX software.
So you need to install LaTeX, if you on ubuntu(linux with apt-get) platform, can use:
\begin{quote}
sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-*
\end{quote}


if you need multi-lang, for example cjk:

\begin{quote}
sudo apt-get install latex-cjk-all
\end{quote}


and use it in your templates.

We have a demo in \textit{ demo.py }, if you had installed LaTeX, can use it to compile this README demo.

\section{Basic syntax in markdown}


\begin{quote}
Small memo with MarkDown, Big paper with LaTeX.
\end{quote}


I am sorry to that the package only can use the following syntax
and also can't insert newline symbol(except in block content)
It only a model for easy to use, sure you can use LaTeX syntax by pyLatex, it's beautiful but not conciser than markdown.
